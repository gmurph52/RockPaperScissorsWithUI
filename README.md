# RockPaperScissorsWithUI
This is for a rock, paper, scissors game between a user and a robotic arm. This is made to run on Unity and uses a Leap Motion camera. The game also includes a "Hand mirroring" feature where the robotic hand will mimic the user's hand. The scripts for this game were written in C#. 

This was a project that I did for my "Senior Project" class. The entire Unity project is included in this repository. For someone looking at how the game was implemented the main files of interest are the .cs files below:
/Assests/rockPaperScissors.cs, /Assests/HandMirror.cs, /Assests/Movie.cs, and /Assests/ToggleButtonDataBinder.cs 

I created the first three files listed as well as the UI (built with Unity). The robot arm is controlled by an Arduino Uno. The code for the Arduino is not currently included in this repository as it was written separately by another student.
